  h2 Extended Progressbar

  :markdown
    As of `v2.0`, jWizard comes bundled with a widget that extends the jQuery UI
    Progressbar widget. This extension unobtrusively adds new feature, an
    automatically-updating label that is positioned over the progressbar itself.
    The progressbar widget still behaves exactly as before, and this new feature
    is "opt-in" only. (by setting the `label` option)
    
    That being said, if you have include jWizard, you have access to the enhanced
    progressbar without any additional work on your part. The eventual goal is to
    submit this feature to the jQuery UI team for inclusion.

  h3#progress-options Configuration Options
  .alert.alert-info
    | These options are in addition to the documented options of the&nbsp;
    a(href="http://jqueryui.com/progressbar/") jQuery UI Progressbar Widget

  section#progress-options-label
    h4 count
    dl.dl-horizontal
      dt Type
      dd: code String
      dt Default
      dd: code null
    :markdown
      This option has 2 possible values, each adds a label to the progressbar: 
      
       - `"count"` adds a label that is formatted as `"55 of 100"`
       - `"percentage"` adds a label that is formatted as `"55%"`

  section#progress-options-append
    h4 append
    dl.dl-horizontal
      dt Type
      dd: code String
      dt Default
      dd: code null
    :markdown
      This option specifies a "suffix" for the label, and appends the specified
      string to the generated label text.
      
      For example, jWizard appends "Complete" by default so the label would appear
      as `"3 of 5 Complete"`.
