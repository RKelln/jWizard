jWizard is a user-friendly, flexible and slim wizard plugin for the <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> Javascript Framework.
Based off of the Windows wizards as well as the .NET Wizard Control, it is meant to enrich your user interface with a wizard that helps guide your users through a series of steps,
reducing a large and complicated process into small chunks to keep your users from being overwhelmed.
